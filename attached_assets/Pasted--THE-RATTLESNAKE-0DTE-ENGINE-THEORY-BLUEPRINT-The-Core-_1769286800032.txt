🐍 THE RATTLESNAKE 0DTE ENGINE (THEORY BLUEPRINT)

The Core Idea

A 0DTE lotto-style payoff happens when convexity + timing + positioning align.

On paper, the system’s job is to detect “convexity moments”:
	•	Time is collapsing (minutes left)
	•	Gamma exposure is high (near-ATM 0DTE is thick)
	•	Flow hits the tape (volume accelerates)
	•	Price breaks structure (key level + follow-through)
	•	Volatility expands (IV/realized vol upticks)
	•	Catalyst or crowd ignition may amplify it

The engine is designed to answer:

“Is the market entering a regime where small spot movement produces outsized option delta/gamma response fast enough to matter before close?”

⸻

1) SYSTEM SHAPE (Bird’s Eye)

A) Sensors (raw inputs)
	•	Market microstructure stream: trades + quotes + bars (1s/5s/1m/5m)
	•	Options chain snapshots: greeks, IV, OI, volume, bid/ask by strike for 0DTE
	•	Options trades/prints (optional): if you have it, this is gold
	•	News stream: fast headlines with tickers
	•	Crowd stream: WSB/social mention velocity
	•	Calendar: macro + earnings + scheduled events
	•	Chart state generator: auto-computed levels & regimes

B) Feature Lab (turns raw into signals)
	•	microstructure features
	•	options pressure features
	•	regime features
	•	catalyst features
	•	cross-asset context features

C) Decision Stack (multi-layer gating)
	•	strict gating rules to avoid noise
	•	probabilistic reach estimates
	•	scenario simulator
	•	paper execution + outcome tracking

D) Output Bus
	•	Telegram alerts
	•	internal ledger (for learning)
	•	daily report

⸻

2) THE “STATE MACHINE” (how it behaves over time)

The engine is not always in “attack mode.” It has states.

State 0 — LURK
	•	all sensors running
	•	compute heat maps
	•	no alerts except heartbeat

State 1 — COILED

Triggered when:
	•	options chain indicates heavy same-day concentration near spot
	•	market is compressing (low ATR) into a level
	•	time window is approaching (post-lunch / power hour)

In COILED, the engine raises sensitivity.

State 2 — RATTLE

Triggered when:
	•	microstructure ignition starts (range + volume expands)
	•	headline/crowd ignition appears
	•	strike clustering begins pulling

In RATTLE, the engine begins publishing “watch” events (still no paper strike).

State 3 — STRIKE

Triggered only when:
	•	price confirms structure break/reclaim
	•	options pressure confirms directional bias
	•	regime filter allows
	•	probability clears threshold

In STRIKE, the engine triggers a paper execution simulation (and alert).

State 4 — CONSTRICT

Post-strike management:
	•	monitor follow-through
	•	update trailing invalidation logic
	•	enforce time stop

State 5 — VENOM REPORT

End-of-day postmortem:
	•	what fired, what worked, what was fake
	•	weight updates for future

⸻

3) DATA OBJECTS (what it “knows”)

This system works by building structured “objects” in memory.

A) MarketSnapshot(ticker, t)

Includes:
	•	last price
	•	returns across windows (1m/5m/15m)
	•	volume across windows
	•	spread proxy (bid/ask)
	•	VWAP position
	•	distance to key levels

B) ChainSnapshot(ticker, expiry=0DTE, t)

For each strike:
	•	bid/ask
	•	last
	•	volume
	•	OI
	•	IV
	•	delta/gamma/theta/vega
	•	implied move and skew

C) LevelMap(ticker, t)
	•	day high/low
	•	premarket high/low
	•	prior day high/low
	•	VWAP
	•	anchored VWAP(s)
	•	round numbers / pivots
	•	“liquidity pools” (auto-detected)

D) FlowPulse(ticker, t)
	•	rate of change of options volume near ATM
	•	strike clustering score
	•	call vs put pressure near ATM
	•	“magnet gradient” score (pull toward strike)
	•	“chase risk” score (already moved too far too fast?)

E) CatalystEvent(ticker, t)
	•	headline text
	•	classification: ticker-specific / macro / market-wide
	•	severity score
	•	credibility score (source weighting)

F) CrowdHeat(ticker, t)
	•	mention velocity
	•	sentiment & intent (0DTE language)
	•	uniqueness score (pump detection)
	•	momentum score

G) RegimeState(market, t)
	•	trend vs chop
	•	volatility regime
	•	risk-on/off
	•	time-of-day behavioral baseline

H) SetupCandidate(ticker, t)
	•	setup family tag (e.g., VWAP reclaim + call pressure)
	•	directional bias (conditional)
	•	score breakdown
	•	probability estimates
	•	“kill reasons” list (what could invalidate)

⸻

4) FEATURE ENGINE (the juice)

A) Microstructure features (spot behavior)
	•	Range Expansion Ratio:
	•	RER = current_5m_range / median_5m_range_last_20
	•	Volume Acceleration Ratio:
	•	VAR = current_5m_vol / avg_5m_vol_last_20
	•	VWAP Interaction:
	•	above/below, reclaim/lose, time held
	•	Break + Follow-through:
	•	did it close beyond a level, then hold for N bars?
	•	Spread/Liquidity Penalty:
	•	wide spreads reduce confidence

Goal: Confirm “real movement,” not noise.

⸻

B) Options pressure features (0DTE mechanics)

This is where “$800 → $40k” moments live.

Key features:

1) Strike Clustering Score

Measures whether volume/OI is concentrated near spot.
	•	High clustering = potential “magnet zone”

2) Near-ATM Imbalance
	•	Compare call vs put volume near ATM strikes
	•	Compare delta-weighted exposure

3) IV Expansion Rate
	•	How quickly IV is rising
	•	Rising IV can mean “market pricing urgency”

4) Gamma Proxy / Sensitivity

Even if you don’t have full dealer GEX, you can approximate:
	•	Is gamma high near ATM (greeks indicate responsiveness)?
	•	Is time-to-expiry low enough that gamma is extreme?

5) Late-Day Burst Detector

Detects sudden surges in same-day option volume after 2pm ET.
This is where “last-minute” moves often begin.

⸻

C) Probability engine (the math layer)

You compute:

Probability of tagging a level before close

Inputs:
	•	time remaining (minutes)
	•	implied volatility (or IV proxy)
	•	realized volatility (short window)
	•	distance to target level/strike
	•	regime multiplier

Output:
	•	P(hit target by close)
	•	expected move band
	•	confidence tier

This doesn’t guarantee anything; it measures how plausible the tag is.

⸻

D) Regime awareness (when the market lies)

A lot of 0DTE traders die in chop because signals “look real.”

Regime engine outputs:
	•	CHOP / TREND / PANIC / EUPHORIA
Rules:
	•	In CHOP: require stricter confirmation to strike
	•	In TREND: allow earlier strikes
	•	In PANIC: widen risk penalties

⸻

5) DECISION STACK (how it decides to “strike”)

This is multi-layer because 0DTE is pure deception.

Layer 1: Candidate eligibility
	•	in allowed tickers
	•	in allowed time window (or allowed special case)

Layer 2: Microstructure ignition gate
	•	RER and VAR above thresholds
	•	structure break/reclaim confirmed

Layer 3: Options confirmation gate
	•	clustering high
	•	near-ATM imbalance confirms bias
	•	late-day burst present (if late-day strike)

Layer 4: Probability gate
	•	probability above threshold OR probability rising quickly

Layer 5: Risk gate
	•	not in dead chop
	•	not illiquid
	•	no “chase” (already moved too far)

If all pass → STRIKE EVENT

⸻

6) PAPER EXECUTION SIMULATION (lab conditions)

Each STRIKE creates a standardized paper “trade plan” object:
	•	entry trigger (conditional)
	•	option selection rule (nearest ATM 0DTE)
	•	paper risk unit (fixed budget)
	•	invalidation rule (VWAP / level failure)
	•	targets (R-based + level-based)
	•	time stop (very important for 0DTE)
	•	exit at end-of-day regardless

The point is not to win every time.
It’s to measure whether the setup family produces positive expectancy.

⸻

7) LEARNING LOOP (where it becomes supernatural)

Every day the engine updates:
	•	which features correlated with success
	•	which setup families are real
	•	which time windows produce convexity
	•	how thresholds should adapt by regime

It becomes a market-specific hunter tuned to:
	•	power hour behavior
	•	specific tickers
	•	volatility regime changes

⸻

8) ADD

A) Cross-asset radar
	•	watch ES/NQ futures movement vs SPY/QQQ
	•	watch VIX spikes vs IV changes
	•	watch DXY / rates moves for macro shock

B) Liquidity sweep detection
	•	detect stop runs near highs/lows
	•	detect rapid mean reversion traps

C) Vision-based chart reading
	•	feed chart images
	•	extract pattern + levels + “setup grade”
This adds human-like reasoning.

D) Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph)

Agents:
	•	Flow agent
	•	Microstructure agent
	•	News agent
	•	Regime agent
	•	Scenario simulator agent
	•	Paper execution agent
	•	Learning agent

The final “strike decision” is a consensus artifact.
