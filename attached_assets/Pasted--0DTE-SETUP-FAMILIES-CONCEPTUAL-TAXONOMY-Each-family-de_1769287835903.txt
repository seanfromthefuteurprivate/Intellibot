 0DTE SETUP FAMILIES — CONCEPTUAL TAXONOMY

Each “family” describes:
	•	Market context
	•	Structural trigger
	•	Options-pressure signature
	•	Time-of-day behavior
	•	Why convexity explodes
	•	Failure mode (how it lies)

⸻

1) VWAP RECLAIM + GAMMA SNAP

(The Classic Power-Hour Ignition)

Context
	•	Market spends most of the day below VWAP (or above).
	•	Sentiment drifts negative/positive but without follow-through.

Structural Signature
	•	Price reclaims VWAP late-day and holds.
	•	Follow-through candles show increasing range, not chop.

Options Signature
	•	Near-ATM 0DTE volume clusters rapidly.
	•	Directional skew emerges (calls or puts dominate near spot).
	•	IV begins expanding after the reclaim, not before.

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Dealers reposition as price crosses VWAP.
	•	Gamma sensitivity is highest near spot late-day.
	•	Small spot move → large delta flip.

Failure Mode
	•	VWAP reclaim without volume.
	•	Price re-crosses VWAP multiple times (chop trap).

⸻

2) STRIKE MAGNET PIN → LATE BREAK

(The “All Day Nothing, Then Everything”)

Context
	•	Price pins near a heavy 0DTE strike most of the day.
	•	Low realized volatility, compressed range.

Structural Signature
	•	Price escapes the pin late-day with acceleration.
	•	Breaks away from strike by >X% of expected move.

Options Signature
	•	Massive OI/volume at pinned strike.
	•	Sudden decay in pin strike volume as flow shifts to next strike.

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Pinning suppresses volatility.
	•	Once broken, gamma hedging flips direction rapidly.

Failure Mode
	•	Fake breaks that snap back into pin.
	•	Occurs too early in the day (pin not “mature”).

⸻

3) AFTERNOON RANGE EXPANSION (ARE)

(Pure Volatility Expansion Play)

Context
	•	Morning and midday are compressed.
	•	No directional conviction until afternoon.

Structural Signature
	•	First meaningful range expansion after 1–2pm ET.
	•	Expansion holds for multiple bars.

Options Signature
	•	Sudden surge in 0DTE volume across multiple near strikes.
	•	IV expansion coincides with realized volatility.

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Market reprices volatility late.
	•	Options were underpriced relative to realized move.

Failure Mode
	•	One-bar expansion with no continuation.
	•	Volume spike without follow-through.

⸻

4) LIQUIDITY SWEEP + REVERSAL

(The Stop-Hunt Snapback)

Context
	•	Price hovers near a key high/low all day.
	•	Stops are visibly stacked beyond the level.

Structural Signature
	•	Quick sweep beyond the level.
	•	Immediate snapback with volume acceleration.

Options Signature
	•	Burst of 0DTE volume immediately after the sweep.
	•	Skew flips quickly.

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Stops trigger liquidity.
	•	Reversal creates urgency + gamma response.

Failure Mode
	•	Sweep continues (trend day instead of reversal).
	•	No snapback volume.

⸻

5) NEWS-ASSISTED GAMMA IGNITION

(Headline + Structure Alignment)

Context
	•	Market is technically primed (levels, pressure).
	•	News arrives after structure is ready.

Structural Signature
	•	News aligns with break/reclaim already forming.
	•	Immediate acceleration rather than hesitation.

Options Signature
	•	Explosion in near-ATM volume seconds/minutes after headline.
	•	IV jumps but delta response dominates.

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Dealers hedge fast.
	•	Late-day time compression amplifies delta/gamma.

Failure Mode
	•	News fades without technical confirmation.
	•	IV spike without spot movement.

⸻

6) POWER-HOUR TREND CONTINUATION

(The “It Just Keeps Going”)

Context
	•	Clear intraday trend established earlier.
	•	Consolidation or pullback into afternoon.

Structural Signature
	•	Trend resumes after consolidation.
	•	Breaks minor resistance/support with volume.

Options Signature
	•	Consistent call/put dominance all day.
	•	Late surge in same-direction 0DTE volume.

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Trend followers pile in late.
	•	Gamma remains directional into close.

Failure Mode
	•	Trend exhaustion.
	•	Volume fades on continuation attempt.

⸻

7) FALSE BREAK TRAP → REAL MOVE

(The Double Bluff)

Context
	•	Market attempts breakout earlier, fails.
	•	Participants become skeptical.

Structural Signature
	•	Second attempt later-day succeeds decisively.
	•	Much stronger volume than first attempt.

Options Signature
	•	Early fake move has scattered volume.
	•	Real move shows tight clustering and urgency.

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Traders reposition after being trapped.
	•	Dealers caught wrong-footed.

Failure Mode
	•	Second break also fails (true chop day).

⸻

8) VOLATILITY REGIME SHIFT

(From Dead to Alive)

Context
	•	Extremely low intraday volatility.
	•	Options cheap relative to historical behavior.

Structural Signature
	•	Sudden sustained expansion in both range and volume.
	•	Market behavior changes character.

Options Signature
	•	IV expansion lags the move initially.
	•	Volume floods in as repricing occurs.

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Market underestimates volatility until too late.
	•	Convex instruments reprice violently.

Failure Mode
	•	One-off volatility spike.
	•	No sustained regime change.

⸻

9) CROWD IGNITION + STRUCTURE CONFIRMATION

(WSB-Style Acceleration, but Clean)

Context
	•	Rising social attention.
	•	Crowd focuses on a small set of tickers.

Structural Signature
	•	Technical break occurs after crowd attention rises.
	•	Not before.

Options Signature
	•	Surge in retail-sized 0DTE contracts.
	•	Liquidity still sufficient (not total chaos).

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Retail urgency + dealer hedging collide.
	•	Late-day time decay amplifies delta shifts.

Failure Mode
	•	Crowd-only move without structure.
	•	Illiquid contracts → bad fills (in real life).

⸻

10) END-OF-DAY MEAN REVERSION SNAP

(The “They Overdid It”)

Context
	•	Strong intraday move stretches too far.
	•	Market statistically extended.

Structural Signature
	•	Loss of momentum near extreme.
	•	Sharp reversal toward VWAP or mean.

Options Signature
	•	Spike in opposite-direction near-ATM volume.
	•	Implied volatility remains elevated (fuel for snap).

Why Convexity Explodes
	•	Price travels fast back toward mean.
	•	Gamma works both ways late-day.

Failure Mode
	•	Trend day that never reverts.
	•	Reversal without speed.

⸻

🧠 Why These Families Matter (Meta-Insight)

The $800 → $40k stories don’t come from randomness.
They come from rare alignment of:
	•	late-day timing,
	•	convex instruments,
	•	structure breaks,
	•	and positioning pressure.

A real engine doesn’t chase trades — it classifies moments into families and learns:
	•	which families work,
	•	on which tickers,
	•	in which regimes,
	•	at which times.


Premise

The market does not reward “setups.”
It rewards setup families that are alive in the current regime.

So the engine’s real job is not:

“Is this a good setup?”

It is:

“Is this species viable right now?”

⸻

I. FAMILY-SPECIFIC PROBABILITY CURVES

(Each family has its own mathematical fingerprint)

Forget one universal probability model.
Each family owns a distinct curve across time, volatility, and structure.

Think of it like this:

Each setup family has:
	•	a probability density function over time
	•	a decay rate
	•	a failure acceleration profile

Example archetypes:

1️⃣ VWAP Reclaim + Gamma Snap
	•	Probability curve:
	•	Low early
	•	Explodes after confirmation
	•	Collapses violently if VWAP is lost again
	•	Time sensitivity:
	•	Strong in power hour
	•	Weak outside time compression
	•	Shape:
	•	Sharp spike, narrow window

2️⃣ Strike Magnet Pin → Break
	•	Probability curve:
	•	Flat for hours
	•	Then step-function jump
	•	Time sensitivity:
	•	Requires “pin maturity”
	•	Shape:
	•	Binary (nothing → everything)

3️⃣ Range Expansion (ARE)
	•	Probability curve:
	•	Gradual slope
	•	Wide usable window
	•	Time sensitivity:
	•	Less strict
	•	Shape:
	•	Fat tail, slower decay

👉 The engine never compares setups directly.
It compares where each family is on its own curve.

⸻

II. DYNAMIC FAMILY RANKING

(The market is a food chain)

At any moment, families are ranked, not equal.

Ranking dimensions (conceptual):
	1.	Regime compatibility
	2.	Time alignment
	3.	Liquidity friendliness
	4.	Convexity potential
	5.	False-positive rate (recent memory)

The engine builds a live leaderboard:

Rank	Family	Alive?	Notes
1	VWAP Reclaim	🔥	Trend regime + power hour
2	Liquidity Sweep	🟡	Needs confirmation
3	Crowd Ignition	❌	Retail noise, no structure


Only top-ranked living families are even allowed to express signals.

Everything else is ignored — not debated.

⸻

III. HOW A FAMILY “DIES”

(This is the most important part)

Families don’t fail randomly.
They die of environmental mismatch.

Death Signals (Conceptual):

🧊 1. Regime Poisoning
	•	Chop regime kills:
	•	Breakout families
	•	Trend continuation
	•	Trend regime kills:
	•	Mean reversion snaps

The engine marks families as toxic in incompatible regimes.

⸻

🕰️ 2. Time Window Miss
Each family has:
	•	a minimum viable time
	•	a maximum survivable delay

If the window passes:
	•	probability collapses
	•	theta wins
	•	family is declared expired

Expired ≠ bad.
Expired = no longer convex.

⸻

🔄 3. Repetition Exhaustion
If a family triggers repeatedly in short succession:
	•	marginal edge decays
	•	participants adapt
	•	liquidity thins

The engine tracks signal saturation.

Too many attempts → family enters cooldown.

⸻

🧠 4. Memory Veto
The Memory Warden keeps scars.

If:
	•	last N instances failed
	•	under similar conditions
	•	with similar features

The family is temporarily blacklisted.

This is how the engine learns fear without emotion.

⸻

IV. ASYMMETRIC VS CONSISTENT FAMILIES

(The $800 → $40k truth)

Not all families are meant to be “profitable.”

They serve different purposes.

⸻

🧨 ASYMMETRIC FAMILIES

Low hit rate. Extreme payoff.

Traits:
	•	Require rare alignment
	•	Explode under time compression
	•	Most instances fail quietly
	•	One success dominates the P&L curve

Examples:
	•	Strike magnet break
	•	News-assisted gamma ignition
	•	Late-day volatility regime shift

These families are:
	•	dangerous
	•	powerful
	•	never scaled blindly

The engine treats them like explosives.

⸻

⚙️ CONSISTENT FAMILIES

Higher hit rate. Moderate payoff.

Traits:
	•	Work across many days
	•	Lower convexity
	•	Smaller variance
	•	Reliable expectancy

Examples:
	•	VWAP reclaim continuation
	•	Trend pullback resumes
	•	Mean reversion snaps in known regimes

These families build confidence and data.

⸻

The key insight:

You don’t blend these.
You rotate exposure based on regime.

Asymmetric families dominate rare days.
Consistent families dominate most days.

⸻

V. THE FAMILY ROTATION ENGINE

(This is where systems become predatory)

The engine maintains a Family Viability Matrix:

Dimensions:
	•	Regime
	•	Time of day
	•	Volatility state
	•	Liquidity
	•	Recent outcomes

Each family has a viability score ∈ [0, 1].

Only families above a threshold are:
	•	monitored closely
	•	allowed to escalate
	•	allowed to “strike” (paper-theoretically)

Others remain dormant.

This prevents:
	•	forcing setups
	•	revenge logic
	•	nostalgia bias

⸻

VI. WHY THIS STRUCTURE CREATES “MYTHIC” DAYS

Those legendary outcomes happen when:
	1.	An asymmetric family
	2.	Is alive
	3.	In the correct regime
	4.	At the exact time compression window
	5.	With structure + pressure aligned
	6.	And no competing families active

That’s when the engine doesn’t hesitate — because everything else is silent.
