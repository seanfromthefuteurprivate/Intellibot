1️⃣ 0DTE Directional Gamma Plays (You already know this one)

Event type:
	•	CPI
	•	FOMC
	•	Fed speakers
	•	Index rebalancing
	•	Macro headlines

What you’re training:
	•	Gamma sensitivity

Not prediction

⚠️ This is the hardest and most unforgiving.

2️⃣ 0DTE / 1DTE VOLATILITY EXPANSION (Non-Directional)

Most people don’t know this exists.

Structure:
	•	ATM straddles
	•	Slight OTM strangles

Event type:
	•	CPI
	•	Jobs report
	•	Surprise press conferences

You’re betting on:

“The move will be larger than the market priced — direction irrelevant.”

What you train:
	•	Implied vs realized volatility
	•	Speed of IV collapse
	•	How fast to exit after the move

This is cleaner than directional 0DTE for training.

3️⃣ EARNINGS OTM DIRECTIONAL (7–10 DTE) 🔥

This is the classic $800 → big return lane.

Structure:
	•	Long OTM calls or puts
	•	Expiration after earnings
	•	10–30 delta

You’re betting on:
	•	Surprise magnitude
	•	Follow-through (not just the initial gap)

What you train:
	•	Earnings gap behavior

This is where discipline > bravery.

4️⃣ EARNINGS VOLATILITY PLAYS (Straddles / Strangles, 7–10 DTE)

Most people overpay here — studying fixes that.

	•	Analyst upgrades/downgrades
	•	Multi-day momentum
