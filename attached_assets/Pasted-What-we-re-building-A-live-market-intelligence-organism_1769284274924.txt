What we’re building

A live market-intelligence organism that ingests social alpha + market microstructure + options flow + news + chart state, converts it into probabilistic trade hypotheses, and pushes operator-grade Telegram alerts (and optional auto-execution suggestions) with traceable evidence, risk controls, and continuous learning.

It’s not a “Reddit bot.”
It’s a multi-sensor trading intelligence pipeline that can eventually output:
	•	WATCH / WAIT / ENTER / EXIT / HEDGE
	•	Directional bias + confidence
	•	0DTE timing windows
	•	risk flags + kill-switch conditions
	•	and (optional) broker-ready trade instructions (paper trading first)

⸻

Core Outputs (what the system produces)

1) Telegram: Immediate Alerts (High Conviction)

Only when:
	•	a ticker’s social velocity + market confirmation + options pressure crosses a threshold
	•	AND risk model does not block it
Format: short, brutal, actionable.

2) Telegram: Watchlist Digest (Medium Conviction)

Periodic list of tickers to track with:
	•	the “why”
	•	the setup
	•	key levels
	•	risk flags
	•	time horizon (0DTE / day / swing)

3) Telegram: Operator Commands (Optional)

When enabled, the system outputs:
	•	“If X then Y” execution logic
	•	buy/sell suggestion with exact entry/stop/targets
	•	but always with risk gates and confidence labels
	•	paper-trading first; live trading only after validation

4) Signal Ledger (Traceability)

For every alert, store:
	•	the evidence bundle (links, excerpts, metrics)
	•	the computed features
	•	the scoring breakdown
	•	the model decision
	•	later: outcome metrics (win/loss, MAE/MFE, slippage)

Data Inputs (wild mode: “everything”)

Social / Crowd Inputs
	•	Reddit (WSB + spinoff subs): posts, comments, author diversity, engagement rate, acceleration, sentiment, intent tags (0DTE, earnings, squeeze, catalyst)
	•	Optional: X/Twitter, Stocktwits, Discord/Telegram groups (read-only, later)
	•	Keyword detection: “0DTE”, “calls”, “puts”, “IV”, “gamma”, “pin”, “squeeze”, “halt”, “catalyst”, “buying pressure”, “short interest”, “float”, “FDA”, “SEC”, etc.

Market Data Inputs (Real-time)
	•	Price stream (trades)
	•	Quote stream (bid/ask for spread + liquidity)
	•	Volume profile / spikes
	•	Intraday returns (1m/5m/15m/60m)
	•	Volatility proxies (realized vol, ATR)
	•	Market regime signals from indexes (SPY/QQQ/VIX proxy)
	•	Correlation / beta context (ticker vs sector vs index)

Options Inputs (0DTE intelligence)
	•	Options chain snapshots (calls/puts OI)
	•	Intraday changes in OI (if available)
	•	Volume by strike/expiry (especially same-day)
	•	Put/Call ratio (global + near-the-money + 0DTE-only)
	•	Implied volatility, IV rank, IV skew
	•	Gamma exposure heuristics (GEX style, even approximate)
	•	“Pin risk” detection near large OI strikes
	•	“Dealer positioning heuristic” (approx): likely magnet levels / volatility traps
	•	Late-day 0DTE “snap” detector: abnormal volume bursts after 12pm / after 2pm / final hour
	•	Probability engine: “chance of reaching strike X by expiry” using IV + distance + time remaining

News / Event Inputs
	•	Live headlines feed (earnings, upgrades/downgrades, SEC, macro prints, court rulings, product announcements)
	•	Calendar: earnings date, CPI/FOMC, major macro, ex-div, split, lockups, FDA dates
	•	Catalyst classifier: “hard catalyst” vs “rumor” vs “meme”

Chart / Technical Inputs (model-readable)
	•	Multi-timeframe structure: 1m / 5m / 15m / 1h / 1d
	•	Trend state: uptrend/downtrend/range
	•	Support/resistance detection (auto)
	•	VWAP + anchored VWAP
	•	Relative strength vs SPY
	•	Pattern flags (breakout, breakdown, reclaim, mean-reversion setup)
	•	Liquidity zones + gap fills

Optional “Vision” Input (chart images)
	•	Ingest chart screenshots and run a vision model that outputs:
	•	trend state
	•	key levels
	•	pattern classification
	•	“setup quality” score
Used when you want the system to “study charts” like a human.

Intelligence Layer (how it thinks)

A) Feature Engine

Everything becomes standardized numeric features, such as:
	•	Hype velocity (mentions/min, upvotes/min, comment accel)
	•	Author diversity (pump detection)
	•	Social-to-market lag (does price lead or follow?)
	•	Market confirmation score (volume + return alignment)
	•	Liquidity / spread penalty
	•	Options pressure score (0DTE dominance, strike clustering, IV)
	•	Regime compatibility score (risk-on/off)
	•	Catalyst strength score
	•	Technical setup quality score

B) Probabilistic Scoring + Routing

System produces:
	•	A unified Signal Score (0–100)
	•	A Probability of move (e.g., “chance of +1% in 30m”)
	•	A Time Horizon tag (0DTE / intraday / swing)
	•	A Risk Tier (low/medium/high)
	•	A Recommended Action (WATCH / WAIT / ENTER / EXIT / HEDGE)

Routing logic:
	•	Only A+ signals become immediate Telegram alerts
	•	B signals go to watchlist digest
	•	C signals are logged but not pushed

C) AI Summarization (operator-grade)

When triggered, AI outputs structured intelligence:
	•	“What’s happening”
	•	“Why now”
	•	“Crowd stance”
	•	“Market confirmation”
	•	“Options pressure”
	•	“Key levels”
	•	“Risk flags”
	•	“If/then plan”

No fluff, no motivational tone — pure operator output.

Learning & Autonomy Upgrades (optional but “wild”)

1) LangGraph Orchestration (Agent Brain)

Use LangGraph to coordinate specialized agents:
	•	Collector Agent: ingests streams, manages rate limits, normalizes
	•	Signal Agent: computes features + scores, runs thresholds
	•	Options Agent: options chain analysis, 0DTE spike detection, strike magnet logic
	•	Chart Agent: technical analysis + levels + structure classification
	•	News Agent: headline ingestion + catalyst classification + credibility scoring
	•	Risk Agent: kill-switch logic, exposure rules, volatility regime rules
	•	Execution Planner Agent: builds trade plan suggestions (entry/stop/targets)
	•	Compliance Agent: ensures messages include disclaimers + avoids bad outputs
	•	Memory Agent: stores outcomes, evaluates hit rate, tunes weights

This is a multi-agent trading intelligence workflow where each module produces artifacts that feed the final decision.

2) Continuous Learning Loop (Outcome-Based)

After each alert:
	•	track what happened (did price move? how far? how fast?)
	•	compute outcome metrics (hit rate, false positive rate, MAE/MFE)
	•	tune scoring weights:
	•	which features predict moves best in this regime?
	•	which signals are noisy?
	•	update thresholds dynamically based on volatility and time of day

3) Command Generator (Optional: “Trade Instruction Output”)

When enabled:
	•	system outputs broker-ready instructions in a strict schema:
	•	instrument
	•	direction
	•	entry logic
	•	invalidation level (stop)
	•	targets
	•	position size suggestion (based on risk budget)
	•	time-based exits (especially for 0DTE)
	•	hedge suggestion (optional)
	•	always labeled as “paper-first” until validated

⸻

Risk Controls (must be embedded)

Hard Kill Switches
	•	No execution suggestions if:
	•	market is in extreme volatility (regime filter)
	•	liquidity is too low
	•	spread too wide
	•	pump indicators too high
	•	news uncertainty too high
	•	API health degraded
	•	Cooldowns: avoid repeated spam on the same ticker unless score breakout is real

Exposure Rules (optional)
	•	per-ticker max alerts per hour
	•	max number of “active” watchlist tickers
	•	risk budget: per day maximum loss threshold
	•	time-of-day rules for 0DTE (last hour behavior different)

⸻

Telegram Experience (what user feels)

“Snake Online” ping at startup

Confirms:
	•	secrets loaded
	•	connectors healthy
	•	running loop active

Immediate alert examples (structure, not content)
	•	headline: “WSB SNAKE ALERT — TICKER — Score 91/100”
	•	why: 2–3 bullets (social + market + options)
	•	levels: VWAP + key resistance/support
	•	0DTE: dominant strikes + time window
	•	risk: 2 red flags max
	•	plan: WATCH/WAIT/ENTER logic
	•	evidence: top links

Digest
	•	top 10 ranked by score
	•	short reason per ticker
	•	one risk tag

⸻

Validation Phases (non-negotiable)

Phase 1: Connectivity + Health

Confirm each connector works in isolation:
	•	Telegram send succeeds
	•	market snapshot or stream succeeds
	•	Reddit ingestion succeeds
	•	AI summarizer call succeeds
No scoring yet.

Phase 2: End-to-end “First Real Alert”

Minimal scoring:
	•	detect ticker clusters
	•	confirm market alignment
	•	push first clean Telegram alert

Phase 3: Options + 0DTE Spike Engine

Add options intelligence and “last-minute spike predictor”
Add probability computations using IV and time remaining.

Phase 4: Learning + LangGraph

Introduce multi-agent orchestration and outcome tuning.

⸻

What success looks like

A system that routinely catches:
	•	early-stage crowd momentum before mainstream trend
	•	late-day 0DTE pressure shifts before the final move
	•	breakouts with market confirmation
	•	avoids most pump noise through author diversity + liquidity + risk penalties
	•	produces Telegram alerts that feel like:
“I have evidence, probability, plan, and risk.”
