# WSB Snake - 0DTE Intelligence Engine

## Overview
WSB Snake is a production-grade 0DTE options intelligence engine implementing the **"Rattlesnake" predator pattern**. It monitors social signals (Reddit/WSB), market microstructure, options chain pressure, and news catalysts to detect late-day volatility surges and "lottery ticket" setups. The system fuses multi-source signals into scored alerts sent via Telegram, with paper trading simulation and self-learning capabilities.

## Current Status
- **Phase 1:** Connectivity + Health ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 2:** End-to-End Signal Pipeline ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 3:** 0DTE Intelligence Engine ✅ COMPLETE (6 engines built)
- **Phase 4:** Enhanced Technical Analysis ✅ COMPLETE (RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA)
- **Phase 5:** Rattlesnake Pattern ✅ COMPLETE (State Machine + Probability Engine + Chop Filter)

## The Rattlesnake Pattern

The engine behaves like a **predator** using a formal state machine:

### State Machine (6 States)

| State | Description | Entry Conditions |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **LURK** | Passive monitoring, building heat maps | Default state |
| **COILED** | Conditions building, sensitivity raised | Time alignment (approaching power hour) |
| **RATTLE** | Warning signals, publishing "watch" events | ≥2 ignition signals (volume + catalyst + momentum) |
| **STRIKE** | Attack mode, triggering alerts/paper trades | Structure break + direction confirmed + P(hit)>55% |
| **CONSTRICT** | Post-strike management | After strike executed |
| **VENOM** | End-of-day postmortem | At market close |

### Why State Machine?
- **Prevents premature alerts**: Signals must escalate through states before triggering
- **Reduces false positives**: Multiple conditions must align
- **Surgical precision**: Only strikes when high probability + structure confirmed

## Probability Engine

Calculates **P(hit target by close)** using:

| Component | Source | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Realized Volatility | Recent price bars | Regime-adjusted annualized vol |
| Distance to Target | Key levels (day high/low, VWAP) | Distance as % of price |
| Time Remaining | Session clock | Minutes to close |
| Regime Scalar | Market classification | Trend/chop/panic multipliers |

### Hazard Curve
- P(hit in next 5 min)
- P(hit in next 10 min)
- P(hit in next 20 min)
- P(hit by close)

### Entry Quality Assessment
- **Optimal**: High near-term probability + high overall probability
- **Acceptable**: Medium probability window
- **Poor**: Low probability or time running out

## Chop Kill Filter

Blocks signals in choppy, fake-breakout conditions:

| Metric | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Range Compression | 30 | Low ATR into a level = compression |
| Trend Strength | 40 | Weak trend = chop |
| VWAP Crossings | 30 | Many crosses = whipsaw |

**Block threshold**: Score ≥60

## The 6 Core Engines

| Engine | Name | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | Ignition Detector | Detects early momentum bursts + RSI/MACD signals |
| 2 | Pressure Engine | Technical analysis + strike structure + market regime |
| 3 | Surge Hunter | Finds power hour setups (VWAP, breakouts) |
| 4 | Probability Generator | Fuses all signals into probability scores |
| 5 | Learning Memory | Tracks outcomes and adjusts weights |
| 6 | Paper Trader | Simulates trades and generates daily reports |

## Enhanced Polygon Basic Plan Usage

The system maximizes Polygon.io basic plan with these endpoints:

### Available Data Sources
| Endpoint | Usage | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Stock Aggregates (1min) | Intraday momentum detection | ✅ Working |
| Previous Day Agg | Gap analysis | ✅ Working |
| Stock Snapshot | Real-time quotes | ✅ Working |
| **RSI Indicator** | Overbought/oversold detection | ✅ Working |
| **SMA Indicator** | Trend following | ✅ Working |
| **EMA Indicator** | Fast moving average | ✅ Working |
| **MACD Indicator** | Momentum crossovers | ✅ Working |
| Gainers/Losers | Market regime detection | ✅ Working |
| Options Contracts | Strike structure analysis | ✅ Working |
| Options Snapshot | Real-time IV/volume | ❌ Requires upgrade |

### Technical Signals Detected
- RSI_OVERBOUGHT / RSI_OVERSOLD
- RSI_RISING / RSI_FALLING
- ABOVE_SMA20 / BELOW_SMA20
- EMA_ABOVE_SMA / EMA_BELOW_SMA
- MACD_BULLISH / MACD_BEARISH
- GAP_UP / GAP_DOWN
- VOLUME_SURGE / VOLUME_DRY
- NEAR_DAY_HIGH / NEAR_DAY_LOW

### Market Regime Detection
- Uses Gainers/Losers ratio to classify market:
  - strong_bullish / bullish / neutral / bearish / strong_bearish
- Boosts aligned signals, reduces counter-trend signals
