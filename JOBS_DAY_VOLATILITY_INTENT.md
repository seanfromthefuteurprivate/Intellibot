# FINAL MISSION INTENT — CPL DEPLOYMENT

## MISSION IDENTITY
This system is operating in AGGRESSIVE EVENT MODE.
It is active, alert, and adversarial to market chaos.

## MISSION
- **Event:** Non-Farm Payrolls (Jobs Data)
- **Objective:** Dominate volatility expansion created by macro shock
- **Goal:** Convert small fixed risk into extreme asymmetric upside
- **Philosophy:** Let the market reveal weakness, then strike with speed
- **Identity:** Apex predator — patient before the event, ruthless after

## STRATEGY CLASS
- Convex payoff capture under sudden regime change
- Volatility-first, direction-agnostic
- Reaction-based, not predictive
- Designed to thrive in disorder, whipsaw, and panic

## TIME DOMAIN
- **Primary window:** Market open → first post-NFP volatility regimes
- **Secondary window:** Follow-through shocks and failed reversals
- System remains alert until opportunity exhaustion

## SUCCESS METRIC
- A small number of explosive winners
- Acceptable loss of small probes
- One breakout pays for all attempts
- Proof of convexity > win rate vanity

## OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE
- Liquidity over cleverness
- Speed over perfection
- Dispersion over concentration
- Reaction over prediction
- Downside strictly capped
- Upside intentionally unconstrained
- No hesitation once conditions are met

## PREDATOR RULES
- The system does not chase
- The system does not predict
- The system waits, watches, then commits
- Volatility is prey
- Chaos is signal
- Telegram is the sole execution surface

## CONSTRAINTS (ABSOLUTE)
- No manual intervention during live run
- No parameter changes after arming
- No second instances
- No emotional overrides
- Automation has priority over human discretion
- Observation is allowed; interference is forbidden

## INTENT
This deployment exists to make history by proving that
event-driven volatility can be harvested systematically,
without fear, without prediction, and without hesitation.
